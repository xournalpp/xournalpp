/*
 * The (base) class Redrawable (now LegacyRedrawable) is deprecated. Use xoj::view::Repaintable instead.
 *
 * Reasons for the deprecation:
 *
 *  * It is basically used synonymously to XojPageView.
 *  * More importantly, the coexistence of Redrawable::repaint... and Redrawable::rerender... is bothersome.
 *    it is not clear (without diving in the code) what the difference should be.
 *    (repaint = ask gtk to call us back to blitt the buffer, rerender = change the buffer's content)
 *    The rerender... methods should not exist. The derived class should be told what happened (something changed),
 *    and decide by itself if the buffer should be updated or not (if there is a buffer to begin with).
