--- Sets the current page as indicated (without scrolling)
--- The page number passed is clamped to the range between first page and last page

--- 
--- Example 1:
--- app.export({["outputFile"] = "Test.pdf", ["range"] = "2-5; 7", ["background"] = "none", ["progressiveMode"] = true})
--- uses progressiveMode, so for each page of the document, instead of rendering one PDF page, the page layers are
--- rendered one by one to produce as many pages as there are layers.
--- 
--- Example 2:
--- app.export({["outputFile"] = "Test.svg", ["range"] = "3-", ["background"] = "unruled"})

--- Adds images from the provided paths or the provided image data on the current page on the current layer.
--- 
--- @param opts {images:{path:string, data:string, x:number, y:number, maxHeight:number, maxWidth:number,
--- aspectRatio:boolean}[], allowUndoRedoAction:string}
--- @return lightuserdata|string[]
--- 
--- Global parameters:
---  - images table: array of image-parameter-tables
---  - allowUndoRedoAction string: Decides how the change gets introduced into the undoRedo action list "individual",
---    "grouped" or "none"
--- 
--- Parameters per image:
---  - path string: filepath to the image
---    or
--- - data string: (file) content of the image (exactly one of path and data should be specified)
---  - x number: x-Coordinate where to place the left upper corner of the image (default: 0)
---  - y number: y-Coordinate where to place the left upper corner of the image (default: 0)
---  scaling options:
---  - maxWidth integer: sets the width of the image in pixels. If that is too large for the page the image gets scaled
---    down keeping the aspect-ratio provided by maxWidth/maxHeight (default: -1)
---  - maxHeight integer: sets the height of the image in pixels. If that is too large for the page the image gets scaled
---    down keeping the aspect-ratio provided by maxWidth/maxHeight (default: -1)
---  - aspectRatio boolean: should the image be scaled in the other dimension to preserve the aspect ratio? Is only set
---    to false if the parameter is false, nil leads to the default value of true (default: true)
---  - scale number: factor to apply to the both dimensions in the end after setting width/height (with/without
---    keeping aspect ratio) (default: 1)
--- 
--- Note about scaling:
--- If the maxHeight-, the maxWidth- as well as the aspectRatio-parameter are given, the image will fit into the
--- rectangle specified with maxHeight/maxWidth. To preserve the aspect ratio, one dimension will be smaller than
--- specified. Still, the scale parameter is applied after this width/height scaling and if after that the dimensions are
--- too large for the page, the image still gets scaled down afterwards.
--- 
--- Returns a table with as many values as images were passed. A value of type lightuserdata represents the reference to
--- the image, while on error the value corresponding to the image will be a string with the error message. If the
--- parameters don't fit at all, a real lua error might be thrown immediately.
--- 
--- Example 1: local refs = app.addImages{images={{path="/media/data/myImg.png", x=10, y=20, scale=2},

---                                            }
