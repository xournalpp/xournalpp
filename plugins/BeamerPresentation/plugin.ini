description=Step through LaTeX beamer presentation. Typical workflow: First use the function which removes all pdf-pages related to an animation. Then, step through the slides with the specialized functions instead of manually going forward/backwards. The plugin will decide whether to in-/decrease the background page (for the animation) or go to the next slide.

## If the plugin is packed with Xournal++, use
## <xournalpp> then it gets the same version number
version=<xournalpp>
