## Please help us with an important decision
We would like to have your feedback concerning the new rendering system. One of the big changes will be that it will support infinity pages. Of course we will still provide support for showing the old multi-page documents. Therefore we would like to know how you want to have these rendered in the future. For this reason we have a small poll we kindly ask you to fill out:

Thanks to everybody that did take part in the poll. The results were quite clear.

We will provide two modes to import multiple page documents:
- Multiple page documents are imported on the limited size pages and the view will show them like Xournal++ currently does. Note that in this mode infinity pages are technically not possible, you will be able to resize pages though
- All pages will be imported onto one single infinity page. You can layout the pages at import into a multi-column/row grid if wanted. For printing we will integrate a feature that shows you the page borders so you end up with prints that make sense.

We might add the mode to import each page onto its own infinity page later on.

## Important Notice
For some required changes to our code base we can currently not admit any pull requests. We are very thankful to anybody that is willing to work on Xournal++ and hope that this inconvenience will not deter you from helping us out. The last PR that will be merged before we do the extensive changes to the code base is #1430, which will then be followed by one last release before our PR freeze. Afterwards we will do the necessary work to ensure a continued solid development of Xournal++. Once we are finished we will remove this note and welcome all your PRs with open hands! Thanks for your support!

## Shout out - Translators Needed!  

Recently we revisited the settings dialog to improve the feeling and usability.
While doing that we also added better descriptions, for which we require
new translations.

Partial translations, which need to be updated:
- Czech
- Polish
- Chinese

Full translations for all languages not mentioned previously **except**:
- English
- German
- Italian

If you would like to help us imporve the localization of Xournal++ take a look at [our Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/xournalpp). If you are interested in translating a new language, contact us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/xournalpp/xournalpp) or create a new issue and we will unlock the language on Crowdin.

**Thanks in advance!**

## Experimental Features:
Sometimes a feature is added that might not be rock solid, or the developers aren't sure it is useful. 
Try these out and give us some feedback.

Here are a few under development that you can play with now.


* <img src="readme/floatingtoolboxmbmenu.png"  title="Xournal++ Screenshot"/> Assign a mouse button or stylus button to bring up a toolbox of toolbars right under the cursor.  You can also modify what is in the toolbox through the usual View->Toolbars->Customize although **it won't appear unless you've assigned a button in preferences: mouse or stylus** ( or selected a toolbar configuration that uses it).
  - This is an experimental feature because not everything you can put in the toolbox behaves. So be aware.
  
    <img src="readme/floatingtoolbox.png" width=25% />




 -  Keep your eyes out for other experimental features in preferences as seen here:
 
     DrawingTools: When drawing a box, circle etc simulate ctrl or shift modifiers by the initial direction you move the mouse.
   
     Action on Tool Tap: Allow a brief tap on the screen to bring up the floating toolbox and/or select an object. May work with pen and highlighter only.

## How to use audio record and playback feature:
- Go to `Edit > Preferences > Audio Recording` and set the `Audio Folder` as well as the appropriate `Input Device` and `Output Device`.

If you need to edit the recording audio gain, take a look at the preferences tab mentioned above.

**Please test this new feature in advance before relying on it to work. It could contain bugs specific to some hard-/software, which we have not yet found.**

### How to record
Just press the red button to start/stop recording and draw strokes using the `Pen` tool. The recording is associated with the drawn strokes and typed text while it is running.

### Play the recorded audio
Use the `Play Object` tool to click on a stroke or text node and listen to the corresponding audio. You can pause and stop the playback of the audio with the buttons next to the recording button in the toolbar.

## Installing
### Ubuntu and derivates
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:andreasbutti/xournalpp-master

### openSUSE
On openSUSE Tumbleweed, the released version of xournalpp is available from the main repository:
```bash
sudo zypper in xournalpp
```

For openSUSE Leap 15.0 and earlier, use the install link from [X11:Utilities](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=X11%3AUtilities&package=xournalpp).

For all versions of openSUSE, bleeding edge packages synced to xournalpp git master on a weekly basis are available from [home:badshah400:Staging](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=home%3Abadshah400%3AStaging&package=xournalpp).

### Arch Linux
The most recent stable release is available [in the [extra] repository](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?q=xournalpp).

To build the latest state of the master branch yourself, use [this AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xournalpp-git/).

### Flatpak

We officially support a [FlatHub
release](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.xournalpp.xournalpp), which
can be installed with

```bash
flatpak install flathub com.github.xournalpp.xournalpp
```

Note that for Xournal++ to work properly, you must have at least one GTK theme
and one icon theme installed on Flatpak.

The Flatpak manifest can be found at the [Xournal++ Flatpak packaging
repository](https://github.com/flathub/com.github.xournalpp.xournalpp), and all
Flatpak-related packaging issues should be reported there.

### Windows
**The windows Version has a Bug:**
Please start Xournal++, touch with the Pen, Quit Xournal++ and start again.
Then Pen input will be working, until you restart Windows. [#659](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/issues/659)

https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/releases

### Mac OS X
Xournal++ will be deliverd with a patched GTK. Else pressure sensitivity is not working on Mac [#569](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/issues/569). (GTK-Issue)

## Building

[Linux Build](readme/LinuxBuild.md)

[Mac Build](readme/MacBuild.md)

[Windows Build](readme/WindowsBuild.md)

## Fileformat
The fileformat *.xopp is an XML which is .gz compressed. PDFs are not embedded into the file, so if the PDF is deleted, the background is lost. *.xopp is basically the same fileformat as *.xoj, which is used by Xournal. Therefor Xournal++ reads *.xoj files, and can also export *.xoj. On exporting to *.xoj all Xournal++ specific Extension are lost, like addtional Background types.

*.xopp can theoretically be read by Xournal, as long as you do not use any new feature, Xournal does not open files at all if there are new attributes or unknown values, because of this Xournal++ will add the extension .xopp to all saved files.

All new files will be saved as *.xopp, if an *.xoj file is opened which was created by Xournal, the Save-As dialog will be displayed on save. If the *.xoj file was by Xournal++ created, Xournal++ overwrite the file on save, and does not change the extension.

**We are currently introducing a new file format that can efficiently store attached PDF files and other attachments internally. We will still allow for attachments that are linked to external files. Please refer to [#937](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/issues/937) for futher details.**

## Development
For developping new features, write a Ticket, so others know what you are doing.
For development create a fork, and use the master as base. Create a Pull request for each fix.
Do not create big pull requests, as long as you don't break anything features also can be
merged, even if they are not 100% finished.

See [GitHub:xournalpp](http://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp) for current development. You can also join
our Gitter channel via the badge on top.

Also take a look at our [Coding Conventions](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/wiki/Coding-conventions)



## Code documentation

The code documentation is generated using Doxygen.
