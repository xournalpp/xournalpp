The files in this directory are used by xgettext and msgfmt to parse and translate properly Linux' mime-info file.
They are only necessary for Ubuntu 20.04. On more up-to-date distributions, the package shared-mime-info contains those .loc and .its files.

They can be removed once support for building on Ubuntu 20.04 is dropped.
