## 1.0.14

**Attention:** users who installed with `make install` will need to follow
special instructions to update. See the "Breaking change" below.

We now officially support packaging Xournal++ using CMake. This allows users to
generate DEB and tar packages. See `readme/linux.md` for more details.

* **Breaking change**: the desktop and icon files were renamed from `xournalpp`
  to `com.github.xournalpp.xournalpp` to be more in line with the AppStream
  specification. This change should only affect users that install with `make
  install`; these users must run `make uninstall` with a cloned version of
  _Xournal++ 1.0.12_ first. We recommend migrating to another installation
  format, such as Flatpak, AppImage, or tarball. Refer to [this
  issue](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/issues/1442#issuecomment-524566511)
  for more details on how to uninstall if `make uninstall` is unavailable. Refer
  to `readme/LinuxBuild.md` for build instructions.
