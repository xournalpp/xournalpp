## 1.2.0

This is a new major version of Xournal++ with many new features, improvements,
and bug fixes thanks to contributions from the community.

* **Breaking Changes**:
  * Linux: support for Ubuntu 18.04 has been dropped. Dependency versions are
    now pinned to those used in Ubuntu 20.04.
  * Linux: added an optional dependency on gtksourceview4
* Added PDF text selection tools (#1745, #3326, #4362)
  * Two new tools have been introduced, "Select Linear PDF Text" and "Select PDF
    Text In Rectangle", used for selecting text on background PDFs. The tools
    support "linear" and "area" selection modes. Double/triple clicking enables
    line and paragraph selection, respectively.
  * The toolbox has buttons that allow a user to: 1) copy the selected text,
    2) generate a highlight stroke over the selected text; 3) generate a stroke
    to strike-through the text; 4) generate a stroke to underline the text;
    and 5) toggle between linear and rectangle selection.
  * Clicking on a link with one of the text selection tools will open a popup
    that can be used to navigate to the corresponding PDF page (if it exists) or
    display a clickable URL (#1027, #4412, #4673).
  * Pressing `Ctrl+C` will copy the selected text to the clipboard (#4436,
    #4784).
* Added Setsquare Tool and Compass Tool
  * The Setsquare Tool toggles a virtual setsquare, which can be used for
    measurements and as a guide for drawing straight lines (#3082, #3882,
    #4211, #4532, #4422).
  * The Compass Tool toggles a virtual compass, which can be used for drawing
    circles, arcs, and radial line segments (#4443, #4422).
  * Mouse, stylus, and touchscreen input can be used to interact with the
    Setsquare and Compass Tools.
  * See the website for more information.
* Colors
  * Added new custom color palette support (#2379). A custom color palette can
    be created in `.gpl` format in the Xournal++ config folder. See the website
    guide for information on how to create a `.gpl` file.
  * Changed the color picker so that it opens with the currently selected color
    by default (#4569, #4575).
  * Fixed the color picker dialog appearing on a different screen in
    multi-screen setups (#4519, #4543).
* Image Tool
  * Added support for loading any image format supported by GDK Pixbuf (#3782).
    For backwards compatibility, images are still saved in PNG format.
  * Fixed some bugs with copying and pasting images (#4466).
  * Fixed image orientation data not being handled properly (#4577, #4583).
* Text Tool
  * Added functionality to automatically select the currently editing text if
    switching to a selection tool (#1169, #4315).
  * Fixed some bugs when handling IM input, improving compatibility for some
    IMEs such as `gcin` (#3841, #4937).
  * Fixed text input remaining active after changing pages (#4027).
  * Fixed bold toggle also removing italics (#4417).
  * Fixed pasted text not using the color of the text tool (#4466).
  * Fixed an issue where `Ctrl+Alt+Left` (or right) would cause the layer to
    change instead of selecting the previous (or next) word (#977, #4797).
* Hand Tool
  * Changed selections to hide the controls when the Hand Tool is selected (
    #4419).
  * Added capability to interact with links on the background PDF (#1027,
    #4412, #4673)
* Stroke and eraser tools
  * Added a system cursor option (#3540).
  * Added stroke cap styles to the file format (#3326).
  * Added a "double ended arrow" stroke style (#2362, #3946).
  * Added a Preferences setting for setting the minimum size of the shape
    recognizer (#4283).
  * Added a toolbar item for changing fill opacity (#4263).
  * Added each line style as a new, individual toolbar item that can be added
    in toolbar customization (#4565).
  * Added a Preferences setting to set the visibility of a stylus-activated
    eraser (#4665).
  * Improved minor graphical aspects of the fill opacity dialog (#3515).
  * Improved performance by rendering strokes with integer coordinates (#4080).
  * Improved the arrow stroke style by scaling the arrow head by line length
    for small arrows (#4055).
  * Rewrote the stroke rendering code to fix bugs and improve performance
    (#3480, #3580, #4304).
  * Rewrote the Eraser tool to be faster and more reliable (#3532, #997, #949,
    #3537).
  * Rewrote the ellipse stroke type to reduce the number of points while
    (roughly) maintaining the same look (#4137, #4320).
  * Fixed a bug where stroke stabilization could produce NaN pressure values,
    causing them to become invisible when exported to PDF (#4381, #4401).
  * Fixed issues involving documents that contain strokes with negative or NaN
    pressure values (#4354, #4401). When such documents are now loaded, points
    with NaN pressure values will automatically be removed.
  * Fixed a bug in the stroke stabilizer where the stroke pressure value may
    sometimes not be set on the last point (#4676).
* Toolbars
  * Added new "Export as PDF" toolbar item (#3508). It and the "Print" toolbar
    item have also been added to the default layouts.
  * Added "Spacer" and "Separator" toolbar items for creating extra space in
    toolbars (#4644, #4674).
  * Fixed a crash that occurs if the application is closed while toolbar
    customization is open (#4559).
  * Updated the default `toolbar.ini` (#4670).
* Layers
  * Added a context menu for the layer sidebar preview (#3204).
  * Added a feature for merging layers down. This can be accessed via the
    `Journal`menu or the new layer preview context menu (#2784, #3204).
  * Added `Edit > Move Layer Up/Down` menu items for moving layers up/down
    (#4352).
  * Added a CLI flag to choose which layer(s) to export (#4143).
  * Added two new tools, "Select Multi-Layer Rectangle" and "Select Multi-Layer
    Region", which are like the existing rectangle/region select tools but can
    be used to select objects on a different layer than the active one (#4413).
* Plugins
  * Added new plugin APIs, including export options, getting page info, adding
    strokes, adding images etc. (#3677, #3566, #3688, #4359, #4397, #4858).
  * Added a new plugin "Export" used to export the current document to PDF, SVG,
    or PNG format with `<Shift><Alt>p/s/n`, respectively (#3566).
  * Added a new plugin "HighlightPosition" used to toggle the cursor highlight
    (#3023).
  * Added support for additional plugin loading paths (#1155, #2422). Notably,
    plugins will also be searched for in the `plugins` folder contained in the
    user's config directory (see the "File Locations" section of the
    website/guide for where to find this folder).
  * Added an `ACTION_TOGGLE_PAIRS_PARITY` used for programmatically changing
    between single and paired page mode. This is currently only accessible
    through the plugin API (#4424).
  * Added a new feature to `app.registerUI` to register custom toolbar items
    (#2431, #2936, #4669, #4671).
  * QuickScreenshot plugin: added `maim` and `xclip` program support (#3718).
  * Improved error handling so that the plugin API returns actual Lua errors
    (#4652).
  * Fixed several issues with plugin-disabled builds (#4726, #4728, #4746).
* Audio recordings
  * All elements without audio now become faded when the Play Object tool is
    used (#2874).
  * Windows: fixed issues with saving/loading audio files with unicode
    characters in their names (#3783).
* Vertical Spacing Tool
  * Added capability to move elements above the line by holding Ctrl (#3334).
  * Improved performance (#3334, #4306).
* TeX Tool
  * Reimplemented the LaTeX editor using the gtksourceview library (#2809),
    enabling multiline input, syntax highlighting, undo/redo, word wrap, and a
    resizable code editor.
  * Added a tab for viewing the output of the TeX command (#2809).
  * Added Preferences settings for changing the syntax highlighting theme, word
    wrap settings, font, default formula, and other settings (#2809, #4264).
  * Changed the TeX background color to become dark when a light font color is
    selected (#2809).
  * Fixed a bug where editing existing TeX will cause its position to change
    (#4415, #4430).
  * Fixed a memory leak (#4088)
* PDF support
  * Added "Xournal++" as the "Creator" in exported PDF metadata (#3523).
  * Added button to propose replacement background PDF if it is missing and a
    file with a similar name is found in the same folder as the `.xopp` file
    (#4165)
  * Added a "default PDF export name" setting that is used when exporting PDFs
    to support wildcards/placeholders for name, date, and time (#2897, #4599,
    #4854).
  * Minor performance improvements (#4004, #4704).
  * Fixed a crash that occurs when exporting to PDF from the command line, but
    the background PDF does not exist (#4584, #4681).
* Floating toolbox
  * Added capability to open the floating toolbox with a secondary button
    (#3270).
* View modes (#4514)
  * The individual default, fullscreen, and presentation modes have been
    reorganized into a "View Modes" setting in Preferences.
  * The "Hide menu bar" and "Hide sidebar" settings now work correctly
    with these view modes (#2773).
  * Changed the `F5` shortcut so that it can also be used to leave presentation
    mode. Removed the `ESC` shortcut to leave presentation mode, which
    conflicts with cancelling a selection (#4480).
* Optimizations
  * Refactored the rendering system, leading to performance improvements, bug
    fixes, and code that is easier to extend with new features (#1795, #4051,
    #3480, #3503, #3969, #3985, #3990, #4304, #4137, #4417, #4158, #4159,
    #4687, #4442, #4271).
  * Improved rendering performance by eliminating unnecessary redrawing
    (#4502, #4493, #4659, #4611, #4637, #4672).

    themes (#4039, #4063).
  * Added an action for toggling the cursor highlight (#3023).
  * Added a Preferences setting for choosing whether to show the file path in
    the titlebar (#3921, #3934).
  * Added an `Edit > Select All` menu option for selecting all elements on the
    current layer (#1917, #4024).

    keys 0-9 (#2007, #4416).
  * Added vim keybindings `Shift+j` and `Shift+k` for page scrolling (#4573).
  * Refactored key event handling such that key-press and key-release events
    are first propogated to the focus window and up the focus chain container,
    thus allowing for plugins using keyboard shortcuts that would otherwise
    conflict with the text tool (#4797, #4811).
  * Added a new setting for automatically appending a new page to the document
    when scrolling to the last page (#1343, #4311).
  * Added page numbers to the sidebar page previews, which can be configured
    in the Preferences (#4624, #4693).

    (#4537).
  * Changed the autosave directory from the user config folder to the user cache
    folder (#3587).
  * Changed the "Apply to current page" button so that it is disabled in the
    page type dropdown menu when "Copy current page" is selected (#4142, #4255).
    This helps to ensure that the corrupt "Copy" page background type cannot
    actually be produced in a document (see #4127).

    (#3368, #4526).
  * Fixed potential race conditions (#4533).
  * Fixed a potential crash that can occur when adding a color selection
    toolbar item to a side toolbar (#4505, #4535).
  * Fixed an issue where failing to create a backup during saving would silently
    abort saving instead of informing the user (#4675, #4715).

    shown when an error log is detected on startup (#4808).
  * Improved the CrashLog by adding the Xournal++ and Gtk versions as well as
    every log message issued via g_message, g_critical, g_debug and so on (#4848).
  * Fixed a mismatch between the app id the window sets and the name of the desktop
    file, leading to the Wayland icon being shown instead of the Xournal++ icon.
    The program name and StarupWMClass were therefore changed from xournalpp to
    com.github.xournalpp.xournalpp (#4870, #4887).

## 1.1.0

This is a new major version of Xournal++ with many new features, improvements,
and bug fixes thanks to over one year's worth of contributions from the
community.

* **Breaking changes**:
  * Xournal++ now follows the [XDG Base Directory
      Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
      (#1101, #1384). The configuration files will now be stored in an
      appropriate platform-specific user data folder. Old configuration files
      will be copied automatically if the new user data folder does not exist.
  * For users that have non-default DPI settings, text elements in old
      documents may be displayed with incorrect sizes/positions. A new plugin is
      included to fix the positioning of these text elements. See the relevant
      bug in the "Text tool" section below.
  * The old input system has been removed, which may affect some users.
  * Windows: The installer has been updated, fixing many issues such as:
      incorrectly set up registry keys, missing uninstaller entry, missing
      entries in Open With context menu in Explorer, missing icons, etc. (#2606,
      #2585, #2387, #2141, #2036, #1903, #2666, #3215). When upgrading from
      1.0.18, you **must not run the uninstaller**; instead, run the updated
      installer, which will clean up files from the old install and fix the
      registry key entries. **If you are downgrading from 1.1.0 to 1.0.18 or
      older, you must run the uninstaller first.**
  * Linux: Support for Ubuntu 16.04 (and older distros) has been dropped.
      Please use a distro from 2018 or later, such as Ubuntu 18.04 or Debian
      Buster. The dependency versions have been updated accordingly.
  * Linux: The thumbnailer program has been renamed from `xournal-thumbnailer`
      to `xournalpp-thumbnailer` in order to fix tab completion (#1752).
  * Linux: Xournal++ now has a hard dependency on `librsvg`. This should not affect
      end-users, only maintainers and packagers.
  * The code has been updated to use C++17 (#1485) and must now be compiled
      using a supported compiler version, such as GCC 7 or Clang 5 (or newer).
  * MacOS: Dropped support for macOS High Sierra; minimal version is now
      Catalina (#2989)
* Document viewing
  * Changed page selection system to now select the current page during
      scrolling (#1613, #1184).

    zoom level changes (#2541).

      calibration setting is different from the default (#2923)
  * Fixed a freeze caused by scrolling between pages of different size (#2770,
      #3099).
* Document export
  * Added a "progressive mode" option to PDF file export dialog. This will
      render layers from bottom to top, exporting a new page every time a layer
      is rendered (#2589, #2609).
  * Simplified background rendering to improve compatibility of exported SVGs
      (#2598).
  * Made line spacing equal in export and on view when pango version >= 1.48.5 is
      available (#2182)
  * Updated the Cairo version on Windows to fix a bug that created corrupt PDF
      files on export (#2871)

  * Added cubic splines as a drawing tool (#1688, #1798, #1861).
  * Click to add anchor points (knots) and drag to create non-trivial
      tangents. Backspace key, arrow keys, s and Shift+s allow to delete/modifiy
      the last set knot/its tangent. Escape key and double click exit the spline
      drawing mode.

## 1.0.15

**Attention**: Please see the 1.0.14 patch notes before installing this version.

* Fixed an issue where copying and pasting strokes would crash the program.

## 1.0.14

**Attention:** users who installed with `make install` will need to follow
special instructions to update. See the "Breaking change" below.

We now officially support packaging Xournal++ using CMake. This allows users to
generate DEB and tar packages. See `readme/linux.md` for more details.

* **Breaking change**: the desktop and icon files were renamed from `xournalpp`
  to `com.github.xournalpp.xournalpp` to be more in line with the AppStream
  specification. This change should only affect users that install with `make
  install`; these users must run `make uninstall` with a cloned version of
  _Xournal++ 1.0.12_ first. We recommend migrating to another installation
  format, such as Flatpak, AppImage, or tarball. Refer to [this
  issue](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/issues/1442#issuecomment-524566511)
  for more details on how to uninstall if `make uninstall` is unavailable. Refer
  to `readme/LinuxBuild.md` for build instructions.
