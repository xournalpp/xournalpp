# Changelog

## 1.1.0+dev (Unreleased)

## 1.1.0

This is a new major version of Xournal++ with many new features, improvements,
and bug fixes thanks to over one year's worth of contributions from the
community.

* **Breaking changes**:
    * Xournal++ now follows the [XDG Base Directory
      Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
      (#1101, #1384). The configuration files will now be stored in an
      appropriate platform-specific user data folder. Old configuration files
      will be copied automatically if the new user data folder does not exist.
    * For users that have non-default DPI settings, text elements in old
      documents may be displayed with incorrect sizes/positions. A new plugin is
      included to fix the positioning of these text elements. See the relevant
      bug in the "Text tool" section below.
    * The old input system has been removed, which may affect some users.
    * Windows: The installer has been updated, fixing many issues such as:
      incorrectly set up registry keys, missing uninstaller entry, missing
      entries in Open With context menu in Explorer, missing icons, etc. (#2606,
      #2585, #2387, #2141, #2036, #1903, #2666, #3215). When upgrading from
      1.0.18, you **must not run the uninstaller**; instead, run the updated
      installer, which will clean up files from the old install and fix the
      registry key entries. **If you are downgrading from 1.1.0 to 1.0.18 or
      older, you must run the uninstaller first.**
    * Linux: Support for Ubuntu 16.04 (and older distros) has been dropped.
      Please use a distro from 2018 or later, such as Ubuntu 18.04 or Debian
      Buster. The dependency versions have been updated accordingly.
    * Linux: The thumbnailer program has been renamed from `xournal-thumbnailer`
      to `xournalpp-thumbnailer` in order to fix tab completion (#1752).
    * Linux: Xournal++ now has a hard dependency on `librsvg`. This should not affect
      end-users, only maintainers and packagers.
    * The code has been updated to use C++17 (#1485) and must now be compiled
      using a supported compiler version, such as GCC 7 or Clang 5 (or newer).
    * MacOS: Dropped support for macOS High Sierra; minimal version is now Catalina (#2989)
* Document viewing
    * Changed page selection system to now select the current page during
      scrolling (#1613, #1184).

      preload mechanism (#2603).

    zoom level changes (#2541).

      #2023, #1830, #2821)

      calibration setting is different from the default (#2923)
    * Fixed a freeze caused by scrolling between pages of different size (#2770,
      #3099).
* Document export

      render layers from bottom to top, exporting a new page every time a layer
      is rendered (#2589, #2609).
    * Simplified background rendering to improve compatibility of exported SVGs
      (#2598).

## 1.0.15

**Attention**: Please see the 1.0.14 patch notes before installing this version.

* Fixed an issue where copying and pasting strokes would crash the program.

## 1.0.14

**Attention:** users who installed with `make install` will need to follow
special instructions to update. See the "Breaking change" below.

We now officially support packaging Xournal++ using CMake. This allows users to
generate DEB and tar packages. See `readme/linux.md` for more details.

* **Breaking change**: the desktop and icon files were renamed from `xournalpp`
  to `com.github.xournalpp.xournalpp` to be more in line with the AppStream
  specification. This change should only affect users that install with `make
  install`; these users must run `make uninstall` with a cloned version of
  _Xournal++ 1.0.12_ first. We recommend migrating to another installation
  format, such as Flatpak, AppImage, or tarball. Refer to [this
  issue](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/issues/1442#issuecomment-524566511)
  for more details on how to uninstall if `make uninstall` is unavailable. Refer
  to `readme/LinuxBuild.md` for build instructions.
