 Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
 does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
 Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
 other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
 information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no
 warranties regarding its licenses, any material licensed under their
 terms and conditions, or any related information. Creative Commons
 disclaims all liability for damages resulting from their use to the
 fullest extent possible.
 .
 Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
 .
 Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
 conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
 original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
 and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
 following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
 exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
 .
    Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
    intended for use by those authorized to give the public
    permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
    copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
    irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
    and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
    Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
    applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
    material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
    material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
    licensed material, or material used under an exception or
    limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
    wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
 .
    Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
    licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
    licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
    the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
    example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
    copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
    licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
    other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
    the licensed material may still be restricted for other
    reasons, including because others have copyright or other
    rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
    such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
    Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
    respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
    for the public:

 By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
 to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
 Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public
 License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
 contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
 acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You

 making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
 conditions.
 .
 .
 Section 1 -- Definitions.
 .

    Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
    and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
    arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
    permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
    Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
    Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,

    closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
    performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
    Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
    categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
    specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
    Rights.
 .
 e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
    absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
    fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
    Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
    agreements.
 .
 f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
    any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
    that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
 .
 g. License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name
    of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this
    Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike.
 .
 h. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
    or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
    License.
 .
 i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
    terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
    all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
    Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
 .
 j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
    under this Public License.
 .
 k. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
    process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
    as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
    dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
    available to the public including in ways that members of the
    public may access the material from a place and at a time
    individually chosen by them.
 .
 l. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
    resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
    the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
    as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
    equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
 .
 m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
    under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
 .
 .
 Section 2 -- Scope.
 .
 a. License grant.
 .
       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
 .
             a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                in part; and
 .
             b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.
 .
       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).
 .
       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.
 .
       5. Downstream recipients.
 .
             a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                Public License.
 .
             b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
             c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                Material.
 .
       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
 b. Other rights.
 .
       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.
 .
       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 .
 Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
 a. Attribution.
 .
       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:
 .
             a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                with the Licensed Material:
 .
                i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                   Material and any others designated to receive
                   attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                   the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                   designated);
 .
                ii. a copyright notice;
 .
                iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                   warranties;
 .
                v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                   extent reasonably practicable;
 .
             b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
             c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.
 .
       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.
 .
 b. ShareAlike.
 .
    In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
